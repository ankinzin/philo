# Philosopher Project

<h1> Overview </h1>
The Philosopher Project is an implementation of the classic dining philosophers problem in C. It simulates a scenario where a number of philosophers sit around a dining table and attempt to eat while avoiding deadlock and resource contention.

<h2> Features </h2>
Dining Philosophers Simulation: The project provides a realistic simulation of the dining philosophers problem, showcasing synchronization and resource allocation challenges.

<h2> Multithreading: </h2> Implemented using C's pthread library for efficient multithreading to represent each philosopher as an independent thread.

<h2> Mutex Locks: </h2> Utilizes mutex locks to ensure exclusive access to shared resources and prevent conflicts among philosophers.
